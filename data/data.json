CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.",

    "description": "JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. JavaScript runs on the client sid e of the web, which can be used to design  program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, w i dely used for controlling web page behavior. Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not Interpreted Java. In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source text).",

    "description": "Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then we presume you will be looking for information about why and how to get started with Python. Fortunately an experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so jump in! Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. If you do need to install Python and aren't conf ident about the task you can find a few notes on the BeginnersGu ide/Download wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms. Before getting started, you may want to find out which IDEs and text editors are tailored to make Python editing easy, browse the list of introductory books, or look at code samples that you might find helpful. There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the BeginnersGu ide/Tutorials page. There is also a list of resources in other languages which might be useful if English is not your first language.The online documentation is your first port of call for definitive information. There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you can browse the ActiveState Python Cookbook",

This paper prov id es various PHP programming framework (CakePHP2, CodeIgniter, Symfony2, Yii and PhalconPHP) popularity overview and comparison using various criteria. Based on the data obtained during the study two frameworks were selected for deeper analysis - Symfony2 and PhalconPHP. This article offers a description of the architecture and main features of selected frameworks (routing, template engine, etc.). During framework comparison a performance test was developed with a goal to determine performance and effectiveness of frameworks during the same task. For performance testing a „Ticket Reserving System” cashier list section was chosen. Tests were performed using ab.exe (Apache Benchmark) tool that comes with the Apache Web server. Based on the comparison results recommendations are made that allow Web developers to choose a framework for creating a real-world Web project. It is planned to expand the developed Web system capabilities using Web services that are based on open standards and protocols (SOAP, XML-RPC, REST, etc.).",

Why was Go chosen by the developers of such projects as Docker and Kubernetes? What are Go’s defining characteristics, how does it differ from other programming languages, and what kinds of projects is it most suitable for building? In this article, we’ll explore Go’s feature set, the optimal use cases, the language’s omissions and limitations, and where Go may be going from here.",
